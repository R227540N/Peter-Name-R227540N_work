Deep Learning Homework 1

This task employed a multimodal machine-learning framework that integrates structured textual features with deep visual representations to estimate property prices. Categorical variables such as currency and property type were converted into numeric codes, and missing numerical values were replaced using median imputation. These processed textual attributes were then standardized, producing eight final structured predictors. For the image component, features were extracted using nineteen pre-trained CNN architectures—including AlexNet, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and VGG16—implemented via the timm and torchvision libraries. Out of 852 listings, only 242 included valid images; for properties without images, zero-padded vectors were used to maintain uniform feature dimensions. A Random Forest Regressor was applied to determine the predictive contribution of each CNN's feature set when combined with the textual inputs, facilitating an efficient model-ranking process. This led to the selection of the top eight CNNs—FractalNet, AlexNet, InceptionResNetV2, VGG16, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, CapsuleNet, and WideResNet50—whose outputs were merged with the textual predictors to create a high-dimensional feature space of 16,904 attributes. A tuned ensemble Random Forest model was trained on this combined dataset, but performance remained poor, with a negative R² (–0.0059) and extremely high RMSE, suggesting the model performed worse than a naïve baseline. Feature-importance results showed that structured text variables dominated overall predictive power at 71.2%, while image features contributed only 28.8%, with VGG16, AlexNet, and WideResNet50 being the most informative among the CNNs. Visual diagnostics—including actual-versus-predicted graphs, residual plots, and feature-importance charts—consistently indicated weak model behaviour, likely due to data-quality issues such as severe price outliers and limited image availability. In summary, the study shows that the current ensemble pipeline is inadequate, and substantial enhancements in data preprocessing, model architecture, and feature engineering—as well as increasing both the volume and quality of property images—are required to achieve meaningful predictive performance.
